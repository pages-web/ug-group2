interests and benefits of its members. It aims to influence state policies, provide the public with the latest and most
comprehensive information on the minerals industry, and foster effective collaborations. Currently, the MNMA
focuses its collaborations with prominent entities such as the Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry, Ministry of
Environment and Tourism, Mongolian Stock Exchange, Montsame news agency, National University of Mongolia, the
Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) and Mining Association of Canada. These partnerships are
crucial in promoting private investments and enhancing the image of Mongolia’s minerals sector through initiatives
like the MinePro International Quarrying and Mining Exhibition & Convention, International Mining Investors Forum.
A cornerstone of MNMA’s efforts is the Responsible Mining Initiative, supported by a broad coalition of local NGOs,
international development agencies, and financial institutions and ministries. This initiative serves as a key platform
for promoting responsible mining practices across Mongolia. Through these strategic collaborations and initiatives,
MNMA continues to advocate for a dynamic and authentic mineral sector in Mongolia, addressing the challenges of

        "Mongolia’s mineral resources industry stands as the backbone of its economy, contributing over 25% to GDP, more than 30% to the state’s general budget revenue, about 73% to foreign direct investment, and over 92% to total exports. This industry’s significance is directly tied to the current economic landscape. Consequently, the Mongolian National Mining Association, in collaboration with the Mongolian Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry, has been organising the “Mining Week” event since 2022. The primary objective is to promote Mongolia’s mineral resources sector to foreign investors and attract foreign investment. The “Mining Week” event in 2023 focused on government policies, decisions, the legal framework in the mineral resources sector, geological exploration, responsible mining, coal, oil, non-ferrous metals, industrialisation, underground mining, and high-tech applications covering around 20 thematic conferences and meetings. Over 300 guests from 20 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, the USA, South Korea, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Japan, Finland, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, France, Spain, and Pakistan attended. Approximately 5,000 participants representing the government, private sector, civil society organisations, and citizens actively participated. In 2024, we are excited to announce the upcoming “Mining Week 2024” event, focusing on the pivotal themes of green energy transition and critical minerals, which currently stand out as significant trends in the global mineral resources sector.As part of this initiative, we are proud to present the “MinePro 2024” exhibition, a collaborative effort that will take place during the “Mining Week 2024”. This exhibition promises to showcase cutting-edge advancements and innovations in the mining industry, bringing together professionals and experts from around the world. Join us for a week dedicated to exploring the future of sustainable mining and the vital role of critical minerals in shaping the trajectory of the industry.",
